module Sunspot
  module DSL #:nodoc:
    #
    # This class presents a DSL for constructing queries using the
    # Sunspot.search method. Methods of this class are available inside the
    # search block. Much of the DSL's functionality is implemented by this
    # class's superclasses, Sunspot::DSL::FieldQuery and Sunspot::DSL::Scope
    #
    # See Sunspot.search for usage examples
    #
    class StandardQuery < FieldQuery
      include Paginatable, Adjustable

      # Specify a phrase that should be searched as fulltext. Only +text+
      # fields are searched - see DSL::Fields.text
      #
      # Keyword search is executed using Solr's dismax handler, which strikes
      # a good balance between powerful and foolproof. In particular,
      # well-matched quotation marks can be used to group phrases, and the
      # + and - modifiers work as expected. All other special Solr boolean
      # syntax is escaped, and mismatched quotes are ignored entirely.
      #
      # This method can optionally take a block, which is evaluated by the
      # Fulltext DSL class, and exposes several powerful dismax features.
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # keywords<String>:: phrase to perform fulltext search on
      #
      # ==== Options
      #
      # :fields<Array>::
      #   List of fields that should be searched for keywords. Defaults to all
      #   fields configured for the types under search.
      # :highlight<Boolean,Array>::
      #   If true, perform keyword highlighting on all searched fields. If an
      #   array of field names, perform highlighting on the specified fields.
      #   Note that for highlighting to work, the desired fields have to be set
      #   up with :stored => true.
      #   This can also be called from within the fulltext block.
      # :minimum_match<Integer>::
      #   The minimum number of search terms that a result must match. By
      #   default, all search terms must match; if the number of search terms
      #   is less than this number, the default behavior applies.
      # :tie<Float>::
      #   A tiebreaker coefficient for scores derived from subqueries that are
      #   lower-scoring than the maximum score subquery. Typically a near-zero
      #   value is useful. See
      #   http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DisMaxRequestHandler#tie_.28Tie_breaker.29
      #   for more information.
      # :query_phrase_slop<Integer>::
      #   The number of words that can appear between the words in a
      #   user-entered phrase (i.e., keywords in quotes) and still match. For
      #   instance, in a search for "\"great pizza\"" with a phrase slop of 1,
      #   "great pizza" and "great big pizza" will match, but "great monster of
      #   a pizza" will not. Default behavior is a query phrase slop of zero.
